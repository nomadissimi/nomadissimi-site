Nomadissimi was created out of lived experience, not theory.

We’re a boutique agency that helps digital nomads and remote professionals move to Italy legally and intentionally. Our work sits at the intersection of immigration guidance, cultural fluency, and real-life relocation support.

This matters because moving to Italy is so much more than a paperwork exercise.

Our team includes people who have personally navigated Italian immigration processes, established residency, dealt with consulates, registered with comuni, and built lives here long-term. We also work with Italian locals who understand the system from the inside and stay current with how procedures are actually applied.

## Why Nomadissimi Exists

We’ve seen first-hand how much misinformation exists around moving to Italy.

Official sources are often incomplete. Online advice is frequently outdated or based on a single person’s experience at a specific consulate, at a specific moment in time. Forums tend to oversimplify processes that are, in reality, highly dependent on timing, documentation quality, and interpretation.

As a result, we regularly speak with people who are eligible on paper but stuck in uncertainty.

Some have delayed their move by months.  
Others have submitted applications that were technically correct but poorly positioned — leading to avoidable complications or rejections.

Nomadissimi exists to bridge that gap.

## What We Do (and What We Don’t)

We don’t offer legal representation, and we don’t make guarantees. No agency or law firm can promise outcomes that are ultimately decided by Italian government authorities.

What we _do_ offer is structured guidance based on current procedures, real-world cases, and a deep understanding of how Italy’s system functions in practice.

Our role is to help you:

- Understand where you realistically stand
- Identify which pathways apply to your profile
- Prepare documentation in a way that aligns with consular expectations --> and explain **how** to actually obtain each requirement. What good is a list if you don't actually know how and where to get those documents?
- Anticipate post-arrival obligations before they become problems

We work selectively to stay accurate, responsive, and familiar with each case we take on.

## Beyond the Visa

We also believe that immigration does not end with visa approval.

Registering locally, understanding cultural norms, navigating healthcare, taxes, and daily systems are all part of successfully relocating to Italy. That’s why our services extend beyond the application phase.

If you’re looking for shortcuts, guarantees, or one-size-fits-all advice, we’re not the right fit.

If you’re looking for clear guidance from people who take this process seriously (and respect how personal this decision is), Nomadissimi was built for you.

Moving to Italy is a major life decision.  
It deserves attention and wisdom.

**Welcome to Nomadissimi.**
